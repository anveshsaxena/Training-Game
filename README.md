# Save the Crew

2D Space Adventure game with target to save the stranded astronauts in the space.

Watch out for the asteroids! Touching them destroys your ship leaving astornauts stranded forever.

This game has been created as part of my initiative to learn to create Unity Game, while completing course with Outscal.
